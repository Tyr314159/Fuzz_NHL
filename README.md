# Fuzz_NHL
Scripts to get NHL game schedules and scores

# Setup Python
- Go to the [python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get the latest python 3.x distribution for your operating system 
- After python is installed run command prompt in windows or terminal on mac/linux
- Download this repository somewhee safe and extract the contents to a folder
- From your command prompt or terminal navigate to the Fuzz_NHL folder using the cd command ex - 'cd Desktop'. Use tab to autocomplete the folder path. 'cd ..' moves you back a level. [Here is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shf5m_Uol9g&ab_channel=WrtTech) to help you with this.
- You may also have to add python to your environment variable path on windows, you can follow the instruction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2q_b4ugPWk&ab_channel=ArturSpirin)
- For these scripts you will need to install a python module, do so by typing 'pip install hockey_scraper'
- Once you have navigated to the Fuzz_NHL folder type in 'python get_games.py' by default this will return a list of today's games and event ids.
- You may add a number after this command to fetch multiple days of games and ids ex - 'python get_games.py 3'

Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug in the code, want to suggest futher features or have trouble following the setup.
